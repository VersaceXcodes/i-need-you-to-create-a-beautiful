# ClawWrapper Landing Page - Design Redesign Progress

## Session: Feb 13, 2026

### Major Design Overhaul Completed

Implemented a research-backed redesign following UI/UX best practices from Nielsen Norman Group studies.

## Key Changes Made:

### 1. Typography (Distinctive, Not Generic)
- **Before**: Inter font (generic SaaS default)
- **After**: Space Grotesk (headings) + JetBrains Mono (technical/code elements)
- **Why**: Creates premium, developer-focused brand identity distinct from "AI slop" aesthetics

### 2. Color Scheme (Premium Dark Theme)
- **Before**: Light blue/purple gradient (generic SaaS pattern)
- **After**: Dark theme (#0a0a0f base) with amber/gold accent (#fbbf24)
- **Why**: Creates atmosphere, premium perception, reduces eye strain

### 3. Layout (Left-Side Bias - Research Backed)
- **Before**: Centered hero and navigation
- **After**: Left-aligned hero content, asymmetric 7/5 column grid
- **Research**: NN Group 2024 study shows users spend 69% more time viewing left side of screens
- **Source**: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/horizontal-attention-leans-left/

### 4. Hero Section
- Asymmetric layout (hero text left, terminal mockup right)
- Dramatic typography scale (text-7xl for headline)
- Clear visual hierarchy with gradient text for key phrases
- Trust indicators immediately visible below CTA

### 5. Animations (Staggered Reveals)
- Intersection Observer-based scroll animations
- Staggered delays for visual interest
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility

### 6. Background Treatment
- Layered gradients with radial accents
- Subtle grid pattern overlay
- Distinct section backgrounds for visual separation

### 7. Mobile Responsiveness
- Sticky CTA button at bottom (within thumb zone - Steven Hoober research)
- Navigation hidden on mobile (hamburger pattern)
- Content stacks vertically
- Touch targets exceed 44x44px minimum

## Files Modified:
- `/app/vitereact/index.html` - Added Space Grotesk + JetBrains Mono fonts
- `/app/vitereact/src/index.css` - Complete CSS overhaul with CSS variables, animations, reduced motion support
- `/app/vitereact/src/components/views/UV_Landing.tsx` - Complete component rewrite with new design system

## Design Principles Applied:
1. **F-Pattern Reading**: Content structured for natural scanning
2. **Fitts's Law**: Large, easily clickable CTA buttons
3. **Recognition over Recall**: Familiar patterns for navigation/forms
4. **Hick's Law**: Options grouped and limited per section
5. **Banner Blindness**: CTAs positioned away from typical ad zones

## Testing Completed:

- Mobile view (390px): Working

- Smooth scroll navigation: Working
- Hover states: Working
- Sticky mobile CTA: Working

## Features Preserved:
