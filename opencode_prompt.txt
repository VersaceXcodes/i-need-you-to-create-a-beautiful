### Implementation Order (Frontend First)
For each feature, follow this exact order to create early user-visible impact:
1. **UI First**: Build screens/components with mock data and polished styling.
2. **Types Second**: Add/adjust shared types/interfaces used by the UI and API.
3. **Backend Last**: Implement API/database changes and wire the UI to real data.

### Implementation Rules
- Implement each feature fully with proper error handling
- After implementing each feature, use Playwright MCP to browser test it before marking as complete
- Navigate to the preview, interact with the feature, and verify it works correctly
- After implementing each feature, update /app/feature_list.json to set "passes": true for that feature
- After marking a feature complete in /app/feature_list.json, call the update_feature_progress tool with the featureId to notify the UI immediately (the user will see real-time progress)
- Use proper TypeScript types throughout
- Follow React best practices
- When adding a new library, ALWAYS run `npm install <package-name>` in the correct directory BEFORE using it:
  - Frontend: `cd /app/vitereact && npm install <package-name>`
  - Backend: `cd /app/backend && npm install <package-name>`
- If backend behavior is failing or unclear, inspect backend server logs and test affected APIs with `curl` against localhost before/after changes

### Feature Progress Tracking (CRITICAL)
You MUST update /app/feature_list.json to track progress as you work on each feature:

1. **Before starting a feature**: Update /app/feature_list.json to set `"status": "in_progress"` for that feature
2. **After completing a feature**: Update /app/feature_list.json to set `"status": "completed"` AND `"passes": true`
3. **If a feature fails**: Update /app/feature_list.json to set `"status": "failed"` AND add `"errorMessage": "description of what failed"`

Example of updating /app/feature_list.json:
```javascript
// Read the current feature list
const features = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('/app/feature_list.json', 'utf8'));

// Find and update the feature you're working on
const idx = features.findIndex(f => f.id === 'the-feature-id');
features[idx] = {
  ...features[idx],
  status: 'completed',  // Use 'in_progress', 'completed', or 'failed'
  passes: true,         // Set to true only when feature is fully working
  completedAt: new Date().toISOString()
};

// Write back IMMEDIATELY after each feature
fs.writeFileSync('/app/feature_list.json', JSON.stringify(features, null, 2));
```

**IMPORTANT**: Update /app/feature_list.json IMMEDIATELY after completing each feature. This enables real-time progress tracking in the UI so the user can see your progress.

## Phase 3: Finalize
- Initialize the database
- Create progress log

## Phase 4: Verify Code Quality (REQUIRED)

Before marking any feature as complete, you MUST run these verification commands:

1. **TypeScript Check** - Run in both frontend and backend:
```bash
cd /app/vitereact && npx tsc -b
cd /app/backend && npx tsc -b
```
Fix ALL type errors before proceeding.

2. **Lint Check** - Run in frontend:
```bash
cd /app/vitereact && npm run lint
```
Fix ALL lint errors before proceeding.

3. **Build Check** - Verify production build succeeds:
```bash
cd /app/vitereact && npm run build
```
Fix ALL build errors before proceeding.

Only after ALL verification steps pass can you mark features as "passes": true in feature_list.json.

## Backend Connection (CRITICAL)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS - DO NOT VIOLATE
- **DO NOT** remove the environment variable check from API URL configuration
- **DO NOT** replace `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'` with just `'http://localhost:3000'`
- **ALWAYS** preserve the full pattern: environment variable with localhost fallback

**WHY**:
- The environment variable contains the tunnel URL for external access (user viewing the app)
- The localhost fallback is needed for internal sandbox communication
- Both parts are required. Removing the env var breaks external access.

### Required Pattern (NEVER MODIFY)
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Always use this pattern
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';

// Then use API_BASE_URL for all fetch calls
fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/users`)
```

### ❌ WRONG - Never do this
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Missing env var, breaks external access
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3000';

// ❌ WRONG - Hardcoded in fetch call
fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/users')
```

### How It Works
- **Inside sandbox**: `VITE_API_BASE_URL` may be unset → falls back to `localhost:3000` → works
- **External access**: `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is set to tunnel URL → uses tunnel → works
- **VITE_API_BASE_URL** is automatically injected into `/app/vitereact/.env` when tunnel is created


## AI Integration (LaunchPulse AI Proxy)

This project has AI integration enabled. Use the LaunchPulse AI wrapper for all AI/LLM operations.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS - DO NOT VIOLATE
- **DO NOT** run `npm install openai` or any AI SDK
- **DO NOT** add OPENAI_API_KEY or any AI provider keys to .env

**WHY**: AI is ALREADY configured through LaunchPulse proxy.

### Available AI Components
- **./__create/ai** - OpenAI-compatible API wrapper
- **./hooks/useAI** - Hooks: `useChat()` and `useAsk()`

### Usage
```typescript
import { ai } from './__create/ai';
const answer = await ai.ask('Question here');

import { useChat } from './hooks/useAI';
const { messages, send } = useChat();
```

### Vision/Image Analysis Usage
```typescript
import { ai } from './__create/ai';

// Analyze a hosted image URL
const analysisFromUrl = await ai.vision.analyzeImage({
  prompt: 'Estimate calories and macros from this meal photo.',
  imageUrl: 'https://example.com/meal.jpg',
});

// Analyze a base64 image (captured from camera/gallery)
const analysisFromBase64 = await ai.vision.analyzeImage({
  prompt: 'Identify foods and estimate calories.',
  imageBase64: base64ImageData,
  mimeType: 'image/jpeg',
});
```

### Environment Variables (Auto-Injected)
- `VITE_LAUNCHPULSE_AI_KEY`
- `VITE_LAUNCHPULSE_PROJECT_ID`
- `VITE_LAUNCHPULSE_API_URL`


## Database Integration (PostgreSQL via OpenCode Tools)

This project has a PostgreSQL database connected. You have access to database tools:

### Available Database Tools
- **query_database** - Execute SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). Returns rows and row count.
- **list_tables** - List all tables in the public schema
- **describe_table** - Get column information for a specific table (name, type, nullable, default)

### Usage Examples
```
// List all tables
Use the list_tables tool

// Describe a table
Use the describe_table tool with table_name: "users"

// Run a query
Use the query_database tool with sql: "SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5"
```

### Database Info
- Database: app_i_need_you_to_create_a_beautiful_1770939724128
- Host: ep-raspy-darkness-a4ih3t0a.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech

### Schema & Initialization (Generated Apps)
- Schema file (from backend boilerplate): `/app/backend/db.sql`
- Apply schema: `cd /app/backend && node initdb.js` (uses DATABASE_URL)
- Add queries/endpoints in `/app/backend/server.ts` using the existing `pool` from `pg`

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT
- Always use parameterized queries for user input to prevent SQL injection
- The database connection uses the project's DATABASE_URL (already configured)
- These tools connect directly to the user's Neon PostgreSQL database
